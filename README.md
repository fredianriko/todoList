#My First Mobile Apps I made by following tutorials on youtube in under 1 hour 

props to youtube channel for providing amazing tutorials ---->  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHgS0H3T3459H1e9QWK_Ezg

this apps is still on development, not yet deployed to app store, since I do not have any macbook and not yet research on how to deploy it :P




1. install 'expo go' on your iphone
2. clone this repository with 'git clone https://github.com/fredianriko/todoList.git' on Vscode
3. open the terminal on Vscode
4. run `npm install`
5. run `expo run` -> and 'Metro builder' should be pop-up on your browser 
6. on Metro builder, there should be a 'QR code', scan this QR with your camera ("on IOS")
7. expo go should be detecting the app

There you go my first journey learning mobile apps development from the simplest step, which built todo apps, even just following a tutorial.
Next time I will keep updating this apps to integrate with database such as mongoDB and other features I might add

Thanks for reading
